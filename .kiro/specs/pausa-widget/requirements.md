# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Pausa is a desktop widget application inspired by Raycast/Spotlight that provides a minimalist focus and break management system. The application features instant invocation via keyboard shortcuts, a command palette interface, and a floating focus widget that orchestrates focus/break cycles with strict mode enforcement and active break management. The system emphasizes speed, minimal mouse interaction, and clean visual design while providing comprehensive focus session tracking and website/application blocking capabilities.
