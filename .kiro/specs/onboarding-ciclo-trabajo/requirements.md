# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Pausa onboarding and work cycle system provides a guided initial setup experience and a complete focused work flow. The system includes an interactive welcome sequence, personalized configuration of work schedules and productivity cycles, and an automated daily cycle that alternates between focus and break periods with contextual notifications and optional screen blocking.

## Glossary

- **Onboarding_System**: The initial configuration flow that guides the user through Pausa personalization
- **Work_Cycle**: The automated system that manages focus and break periods based on user configuration
- **Strict_Mode**: Functionality that completely blocks the screen during focus or break periods
- **Work_Schedule**: The work hours defined by the user to align productivity cycles
- **Active_Break**: Break period with suggested activities for user wellbeing
- **Emergency_Combination**: Key sequence defined by the user to exit strict mode in urgent situations
